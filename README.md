For *A Flexible Anarchy* on [The Actual School](https://theactualschool.com) in May 2015

This site:

1.  Compiles and reformats all keystrokes of three creative workers working discursively on The Actual School's seminar, A Flexible Anarchy from 04/02/15 to 04/16/15
2.  Compresses this two week time frame into a 24 hour cycle
3.  Generates each keystroke at the minute it was originally typed
